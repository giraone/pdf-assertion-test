# This is the license key file to use PDFUnit-Java
#
# If the licensee gives this product to another company or person, the licensee 
# has to pay that license fee as a penalty, which had not been payed
# by the misuser. Of course, the misusing company has to pay the license 
# also by itself.
#
# The minimum penalty fee for misuse PDFUnit is calculated this way:
# - 1 Euro Cent per year of use per PDF document which was
#   produced by that project that uses PDFUnit unauthorized.
# - If the amount calculated in this way is less 1000 Euro, then a minimum 
#   of 1000 Euro per year of misuse has to be paid.
# - The penalty has to be paid by the company or person who gives this
#   key away and also by the company or person who takes this key.
# So at the end the one who gave the license away, pays his license cost 
# AND the penalty. And the one who took the license also pays his license 
# cost AND the penalty.
